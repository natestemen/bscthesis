        {\textbf{Abstract:}}

        {In this thesis we study the dynamics of a complex scalar field with a
            nonrenormalizable potential. In particular we study the existence of the
            non-topological soliton solutions known as Q-Balls. These objects have been
            proposed as candidates to solve the present baryon asymmetry, and arise in
            supersymetric theories, as well as abelian gauge theories, non-abelian gauge
            theores, non-commutative complex scalar field theories, etc. Formulating the
            existence problem using constrained minimization allows for this approach to
            translate easily into the numerical work that follows. With this framework
            the computation of soliton profiles, along with the associated angular
            momentum parameter are achieved. To best understand the work, we present the
            prerequisite classical field theory and an introduction to Q-Balls and
            Q-Vortex solitons.}

\chapter*{Dedication}
I would like to dedicate this thesis to my dog, Jett.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank, Dr.\ Luciano M. Medina, the advisor for this work, for
his continued support throughout this research and thesis writing process.
Without his willingness to give so much time and effort to his students, I
would not have learned as much as I did. His continued insight pushed my
understanding and his generous supervision allowed me to take the research in
directions I wished. For his generous nature I am extremely appreciative.

I would also like to thank Professor Joe Esposito who so kindly extended his
time to help build the foundations of the work presented here. Even in the midst
of raising a daughter he found time to extensively answer and ponder any
question I had.

To my fellow peers Shahmir Shahrol, Igor Pshenychny, Shearyar Khan, Kevin Yeh,
and Kye Drageset who provided great conversations about the work, and any field
of mathematics or physics in general, even when they had had enough of Q-Balls.

And finally, to my parents, Charlie, and Diane who provided unwavering support
and patience, even when they maybe shouldn't have.
