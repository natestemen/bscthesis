# Abstract

In this thesis we study the dynamics of a complex scalar field with a
nonrenormalizable potential. In particular we study the existence of the
non-topological soliton solutions known as Q-Balls. These objects have been
proposed as candidates to solve the present baryon asymmetry, and arise in
supersymetric theories, as well as abelian gauge theories, non-abelian gauge
theores, non-commutative complex scalar field theories, etc. Formulating the
existence problem using constrained minimization allows for this approach to
translate easily into the numerical work that follows. With this framework the
computation of soliton profiles, along with the associated angular momentum
parameter are achieved. To best understand the work, we present the
prerequisite classical field theory and an introduction to Q-Balls and Q-Vortex
solitons.

## What's this all about

So I wrote and submitted my thesis over a year ago, but I'm just now putting it
online. When I was writing it I would have loved to have come across other
undergraduate theses to kind of use as a basis or just provide some expectations
of the level they typically are (not that they can't vary).

Also the nyu-tandon(/poly) thesis template isn't even online, so if anyone needs
it they can not get it from here and just delete all my stuff :).
